//The index.js file in the pages/api directory of a Next.js project serves as the entry point for handling API routes.
// It is intentionally left empty because Next.js uses the file as a catch-all route handler for all API requests that are made to the /api endpoint.
// When you create individual API route files in the pages / api directory, such as myEndpoint.js as mentioned in the previous example,
// those files will handle specific API routes that you define.Any requests that do not match any specific route will be caught by the index.js file
// and then routed to the appropriate API route file based on the request URL.
// By default, Next.js automatically handles the routing and mapping of API routes based on the file names in the pages / api directory.
// You do not need to define any specific routes in the index.js file, as it is used as a fallback catch-all route handler for any requests that do not
// match other specific API routes.
