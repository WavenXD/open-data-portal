# open-data-portal

Open Data Portal for Waterquality Sensor Data

## Introduction

TODO: Add brief introduction.

## Architecture Overview

The diagram shows the different parts of the system and how they interact with each other. The external sensor system
can be found [here](https://github.com/sensor-network/sensor-collector).

## How to Use

This application can be built and run in two ways:

### Using Docker and Docker Compose (Packaged with a mySQL database)

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docker.com)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

#### Build

If you want to build the application image yourself, you can

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sensor-network/open-data-portal.git
$ cd open-data-portal
```

2. Build a local image:

```bash
$ docker compose build app 
```

#### Run

You can now run the application using Docker Compose. If you build the image locally, it will use the local image.
Otherwise, it will pull the latest version from the registry.

```bash
$ docker compose up
```

The application will then start at `localhost:3000`

### From source

#### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 12.22.0](https://nodejs.org/en/) or later

#### Initial setup

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sensor-network/open-data-portal.git
$ cd open-data-portal
```

2. Install the project's dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

3. Verify the credentials in `.env`. By default, it contains the credentials used to connect to the dockerized database
   supplied in this repo.

#### Build

Build an optimized production version of the app:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

#### Test

In order to run the tests, you need to start up the test database:

```bash
$ docker compose -f test-db.yml up
```

Wait until you see that the database is ready for connections (usually < 10s). Then, you can run the tests:

```bash
$ npm test
````

Tests can also be run in `watch`-mode while developing to have them re-run each compilation:

````bash
$ npm test:watch
````

***Note: This project currently does not have a significant test-base. This will be done in the future.***

#### Run

Run developer version with fast refresh:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Or start a built production version:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

In case you dont have a database running, you can also run a containerized database to go along with the application
using

```bash
$ docker compose up db
```

The default credentials for this database can be found in [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml)

Then open the app in the browser at the link shown in your terminal.

#### Load database

When you first launch the application, the database will be empty. We have included a load-script which loads in random,
although somewhat realistic data which can be executed using

```bash
$ npm run fill-db
```

It will automatically create the sensors if they dont exist, and fill the database with random data from these sensors.
Alternatively, you can modify the config to specify existing sensors/location (see [here](docs/README.md) how to do
that) by changing the configuration object in [fill-db.ts](./scripts/fill-db.ts):

```js
const c = {
  /* define time range of when to insert measurements */
  START_TIME: new Date('2021-01-01Z'),
  END_TIME: new Date('2024Z'),

  /* select time interval between measurements (seconds) */
  DATA_DENSITY: 5 * 60,

  /* define what sensors are sending the data */
  TEMPERATURE_SENSOR_ID: 1,
  PH_SENSOR_ID: 2,
  CONDUCTIVITY_SENSOR_ID: 3,

  /* specify the coordinates which the measurement is coming from. */
  LOCATION: {
    LAT: 56.2,
    LONG: 15.6,
  },

  /* define ranges for measurements (in SI-units) */
  MIN_TEMP: 283,
  MAX_TEMP: 298,
  MIN_COND: 3,
  MAX_COND: 8,
  MIN_PH: 4,
  MAX_PH: 9,

  /* define how much each datapoint is allowed to change between each point,
   * the rate is a randomized value between -<change_rate> < 0 < <change_rate> */
  TEMP_CHANGE_RATE: 0.1,
  COND_CHANGE_RATE: 0.1,
  PH_CHANGE_RATE: 0.1,
};
```

Let the script run for however long you like, or until it has filled the time-range.
