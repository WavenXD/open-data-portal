# open-data-portal

Open Data Portal for Waterquality Sensor Data

## Introduction

TODO: Add brief introduction.

## Architecture Overview
The diagram shows the different parts of the system and how they interact with each other. The external sensor system can be found [here](https://github.com/sensor-network/sensor-collector).

## How to Use
This application can be built and run in two ways:

### Using Docker and Docker Compose (Packaged with a mySQL database)
#### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docker.com)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

#### Build
If you want to build the application image yourself, you can

1. Clone the repo: 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sensor-network/open-data-portal.git
$ cd open-data-portal
```
2. Build the image: 
```bash
$ docker build -t open-data-portal .
```

#### Run
You can now run the application using Docker Compose.

If you build the image locally:
1. In `docker-compose.yml`, change `image` to use your locally built image.
```yml
# ...
app:
  image: open-data-portal
# ...
```
2. Then, depending on your version of docker/docker compose:
```bash
$ docker compose up
# or,
$ docker-compose up
```

If you didn't build the image you can use the publicly available image from `ghcr`, in which case you can skip step 1 above.

The application will then start at `localhost:3000`

### From source
#### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 12.22.0](https://nodejs.org/en/) or later

#### Initial setup

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sensor-network/open-data-portal.git
$ cd open-data-portal
```
2. Create a `.env` file and specify the following variables:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_DB_HOST
- NEXT_PUBLIC_DB_USER
- NEXT_PUBLIC_DB_PASSWORD
- NEXT_PUBLIC_DB_DATABASE
- NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY

3. Install the project's dependencies:
```bash
$ npm install
```

#### Build

Build an optimized production version of the app:
```bash
$ npm run build
```

#### Test

Run all tests:
```bash
$ npm test
````
Tests can also be run in `watch`-mode while developing to have them re-run each compilation:
````bash
$ npm test:watch
````

***Note: This project currently does not have a significant test-base. This will be done in the future.***


#### Run

Run developer version with fast refresh:
```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Or start a built production version:
```bash
$ npm run start
```

In case you dont have a database running, you can also run a containerized database to go along with the application using 
```bash
$ docker compose up db
```
The default credentials for this database can be found in [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml)

Then open the app in the browser at the link shown in your terminal.
