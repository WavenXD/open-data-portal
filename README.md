# open-data-portal

Open Data Portal for Waterquality Sensor Data

## Introduction

TODO: Add brief introduction.

## Architecture Overview

TODO: Add simple diagram that explains the architecture.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- [NodeJS 12.22.0](https://nodejs.org/en/) or later

### Initial setup

1. Clone the repo:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/sensor-network/open-data-portal.git
```

2. Create a `.env`-file in the project root `/` and fill in the following:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_DB_URL   = <your connection string for your database>
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY1 = <static api keys used to securely upload data using the `/upload` endpoint>
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY2 = <static api keys used to securely upload data using the `/upload` endpoint>
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY3 = <static api keys used to securely upload data using the `/upload` endpoint>
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY4 = <static api keys used to securely upload data using the `/upload` endpoint>
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY5 = <static api keys used to securely upload data using the `/upload` endpoint>
```

### Build

Use `npm` to install dependencies:
```console
$ npm install
```

Build production version:
```console
$ npm run build
```

### Test

Run all tests:
````console
$ npm run test
````
Tests can also be run in `watch`-mode while developing to have them re-run each compilation:
````console
$ npm run test:watch
````

***Note: This project currently does not have a significant test-base. This will be done in the future.***


### Run

Run developer version:
```console
$ npm run dev
```

Or start a built production version:
```console
$ npm run start
```

Then open the app in the browser at the link shown in your terminal.
